# PyRoboTrade
This bot is being created purely for the sake of learning. It is not intended to make money or take over a full time job. Therefor some of the parameters are very simple as I build things. Things like the number of shares placed or the speed of the program. I like to create functional code then refine and improve from there 👩‍💻

Scope of project has changed to crypto trading
